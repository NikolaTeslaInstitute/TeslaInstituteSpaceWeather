<h2>Radio Burst Summaries</h2>
<p>Radio burst summaries are issued for several enhancements that can be observed in conjunction with a solar magnetic eruption. The Type II Radio Emission, provided by the United States Air Force’s (USAF) Radio Solar Telescope Network (RSTN), are generally indicative of a coronal mass eruption (CME) accelerating through the outer atmosphere of the Sun. Type II observations preceded modern coronagraph imaging of CMEs but can still be useful to indicate the presence or lack of an associated CME. Significant uncertainties exist in determining exact CME velocities with this technique so any stated, observed velocities should be confirmed, when possible, with coronagraph imagery.</p>
<p>The Type IV Radio Emission product is also provided by the USAF’s RSTN and this signature is often associated with significant solar eruptions. Like the Type II, any specifics of an eruption should be confirmed with coronagraph imagery.</p>
<p>The 10cm Radio Burst product is issued when 10cm radio observations exceed 100% of the background solar radio noise at this frequency. This frequency also known as f10.7 is used as a proxy for solar input to the atmosphere, a primary driver for most ionospheric and atmospheric drag models.</p>

<h2>Geomagnetic Warnings, Alerts, and Watches</h2>
<p>Because geomagnetic storming can be predicted with some lead time given the transit time of the driving coronal mass ejection (CME) or the predictability of the responsible solar wind feature, several time scales of products are produced. In general, geomagnetic storms impact the accuracy and availability of Global Positioning Systems, create induced currents on power grid elements and long-distance pipelines, and drive the aurora. See the NOAA Space Weather Scales for the general impacts associated with each storm level.</p>
<p>A Geomagnetic Storm Watch is driven by the forecast of an impending geomagnetic storm and can cover the current day through the third day of the forecast period (or up to 72 hours lead time). The lead time is often largely determined by the velocity of the driving CME, with some of the historically fastest CMEs arriving well under a day (16-18 hour transits have been observed). A Watch carries a lower degree of confidence both in intensity and in timing than the Warning product but is useful for longer-range notification of an expected geomagnetic storm.</p>
<p>A Geomagnetic Storm Warning is driven by upstream, in-situ solar wind observations. Geomagnetic Storm Warnings carry a higher degree of confidence in both timing and intensity but are generally only issued minutes to a couple of hours in advance. These products are generated by space weather forecasters who are evaluating the solar wind conditions affecting Earth. Given the limited number of severe to extreme geomagnetic storms and the limitations in predicting the exact evolution of a storm, a single Warning category exists for Kp &gt; or = 7 storming (or G3 or greater on the NOAA Geomagnetic Storm Scale). SWPC’s space weather forecasters do have the ability to supply additional comments in this warning product and may be able to indicate the specific level of intensity expected.</p>
<p>A Geomagnetic Storm Alert is driven by ground-based magnetometer observations and is indicative of a specific storm threshold being reached. In other words, an Alert is a characterization of what is occurring now.</p>
<p>A Geomagnetic Sudden Impulse (SI) Expected Warning is issued when a shock has been observed in the upstream, in situ solar wind data. Based on the post-shock velocity, space weather forecasters generate a warning period indicative of when this disturbance is expected at Earth. The Geomagnetic Sudden Impulse Summary product is issued when the shock is actually observed at Earth, as indicated by the response of ground-based magnetic observatories. These products are useful in that they can confirm the actual arrival of anticipated coronal mass ejection (CME).</p>

<h2>Proton Flux Warnings, Event Alerts, and Event Summaries</h2>
<p>Proton Warnings, Alerts, and Summaries are issued for two different proton energies, 10MeV or greater and 100MeV or greater. The NOAA Solar Radiation Storm Scale (or S Scale) is driven by the 10MeV or greater measurement. In general, a &gt;10MeV event is representative of any increase in proton fluxes near Earth and a &gt;100MeV event is indicative of an energetic event in progress, meaning particles of higher energies are present in this enhancement. Given the wide range of impacts and phenomena associated with radiation storms, individual users with specific applications may need to consult individual measurements channels not covered by these summary products (impacts associated with radiation exposure at aviation altitudes is generally driven by particles with energies of 500MeV or greater, for example). See the NOAA Space Weather Scales for the general impacts associated with each storm level.</p>
<p>Single Radiation Storm Warning products are issued for both &gt;10MeV and &gt;100MeV events. The &gt;10MeV Warning product will specify the NOAA Scale level of the warning in effect. There is only a single event threshold for the &gt;100MeV product so no additional information on intensity is included in that warning product. Warning times for proton events are generally on the 10’s of minutes to hours timescale. The amount of lead time possible is strongly influenced by how well-connected Earth is to the source region on the Sun. In some cases, well-connected events will exceed thresholds almost immediately, resulting in little to no warning lead time.</p>
<p>Solar Radiation Alerts are issued when observed values at the NOAA GOES satellites exceed event thresholds. Alerts are issued for each NOAA Solar Radiation Storm Scale level, driven by the &gt;10MeV proton flux. A single Alert is issued for the &gt;100MeV proton flux.</p>
<p>Solar Radiation Summaries are issued post-event and will indicate peak intensity as well as the particulars of start, peak, and end times for each storm level (e.g. the S2 Solar Radiation Storm Event Summary will be issued when storm levels have subsided below the S2 event threshold but generally before the S1 Radiation Storm has ended).</p>

The Solar &amp; Geophysical Activity Summary (SGAS) and Solar Region Summary (SRS) are issued daily and provide a retrospective description of phenomena observed during the UT day just passed. See the table, below for more details about these products.</p>
